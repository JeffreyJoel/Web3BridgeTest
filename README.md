# BMI Calculator
This is my submission for the Web3Bridge Assessment. This project was built with HTML,CSS, Javascript and styled using Bootstrap 4.

## Function
* This project allows a user to calculate their Body Mass Index(BMI) based on weight and height inputs that they provide.
* A category is also assigned to a user based on the value of their BMI.  
* Kilogram and Meters are used as the units for this project.
